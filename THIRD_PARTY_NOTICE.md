PlantUML can occasionally display sponsored or advertising messages. Those
messages are usually generated on welcome or error images and never on
functional diagrams.

Images (whatever their format : PNG, SVG, EPS...) generated by running PlantUML
are owned by the author of their corresponding sources code (that is, their
textual description in PlantUML language). Those images are not covered by
the GPL license.

The generated images can then be used without any reference to the GPL license.
It is not even necessary to stipulate that they have been generated with PlantUML,
also this will be appreciate by PlantUML team.

There is an exception : if the textual description in PlantUML language is also covered
by a license (like the GPL), then the generated images are logically covered
by the very same license.
